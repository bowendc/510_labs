The original pipe is built in to the **tidyverse** packages (%>%), and you'll see many example codes online using this pipe. It's great. However, starting in R version 4.1, base R includes a new pipe operator that will work throughout everything in R (|>). Let's look at the example below using **tidyverse**'s *summarize* function, which aggregates data in the ways specfied in the command. In this case, we're summarizing two variables (two separate measures of member ideology, coded so that more extreme ideology is higher) in the ABH.data dataset by asking R to calculate their means. \n"
