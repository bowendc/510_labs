    "## Managing multiple datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Data management is one of the most difficult parts of any empirical project. With data readily accessible from surveys, governmental agencies, interest groups, and researchers, today's policy analysts must interact with a wide variety of dataset that they typically do not control the creation of and may have been generated for use-cases quite different from what the analyst has in mind. In this lab, we will learn a number of useful R functions for \"data wrangling.\" While you may never need exactly these tools in your projects, you might need similar tools, so understanding what is possible in R is helpful. \n",

    "### The project\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine the relationship between population change and the cost of housing across the U.S., a key public policy topic of interest as land use regulatory reform and rent control policies are being considered at the local and state level across the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can get population data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Population Estimates program. But that program doesn't have data on cost of housing or rent. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, however, does have median rents by county. Let's walk through the process of downloading, cleaning, and merging these datasets together. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, as always, we load (and download if necessary) required packages. We will be using two primary new packages: **{tigris}**, which provides access to the Census Bureau's geographic data (we'll just use it for access to geographic codes for U.S. counties), and **{rio}**, which provides some nice functions for reading in different types of data. **{rio}** will use the functions available in **{haven}** and in **{readxl}**, so they need to be installed as well.

    "Every modern stats programs have tools to automate the merging of vectors of data. The way these tools generally work is that there is some bridging vector which to identify the units in data frame *x* that will match with units in data frame *y*. R, as you might imagine, has multiple ways of accomplishing this. We'll use the `left_join()` that's part of the **{dplyr}** package in **{tidyverse}**. \n",

    "`left_join` takes joins two data frames together. If you don't specify which variable(s) in the `by` argument, then the function will try match based on whatever variables you have in common in both data frames. Don't rely on this. Instead, tell R specifically how to make the match. The other thing to know about `left_join` is that it will keep all units in the data frame you list first, and then include whichever observations are successfully matched in data frame *y*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can merge `popest` and `rents`, let's take a look at our current geographic identifiers. We've created a county name variable and a state name variable in `popest` - those two variables identify each observation.  `rents`, however, has numeric codes for county and state (called *fips* codes). The easiest way to complete this merge is to first merge `popest` with a separate data frame that includes state and county fips codes, and then merge this combined data frame with the identifying variables with the `rents` data frame. We can pull the data frame `fips_codes` from the **{tigris}** package to access those geographic identifiers."
